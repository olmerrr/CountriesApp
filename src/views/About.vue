      <h2 class="description__title"> Components of an About Us page</h2>
      <p class="description__paragraph"> In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page should focus more on your
        brand identity and less on sales.
        Here are some components to include:
      </p>

      <p class="description__paragraph">
        Your brand story. Tell shoppers the origin story of your business and why you started it. For the most impact,
        make it memorable and personal, so customers relate and connect with your brand.
        Who you serve. What do you offer and who is it for? Help shoppers see the value of your product or service by
        sharing how it solves problems or needs.
      </p>
      <p class="description__paragraph"> How you operate. If you offer a service, explain your business model or how
        your products are made. If you
        have a
        unique way of doing things, show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand out against
        competitors.</p>
      <p class="description__paragraph">
        The face of your business. Feature photos of the founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who
        they are buying from or working with.
      </p>
      <p class="description__paragraph"> Persuasive content. Consider what step you’d like readers to take next. Use
        additional content and calls to
        action
        to move them forward towards that goal. This could include buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data
        visualizations, links to blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.
        Your About Us page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow some ideas from others,
        especially when it comes to structure and design.</p>

      <p class="description__paragraph">The following are examples of different ways you can tackle your About Us page
        design.</p>
